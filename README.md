Welcome to my GitHub 👋

I build applied data science and AI solutions that translate complex data into
clear, actionable business insight.

My background spans over 16 years in finance, banking, and compliance, and I now
focus on designing end-to-end analytics and AI systems that align with real
business objectives — from executive reporting and predictive modelling to
LLM-powered decision support and multimodal AI pipelines.

Formal training includes a **Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science** and MinnaLearn’s
*Elements of AI for Business*, complementing the applied, project-driven work presented here.
